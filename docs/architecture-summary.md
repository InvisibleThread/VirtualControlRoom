# Virtual Control Room Architecture Summary

## Architecture Overview

The Virtual Control Room is designed as a **native visionOS application** with no backend server requirements. This client-side architecture was chosen to:
- Minimize latency for real-time remote desktop interactions
- Ensure security by keeping all connections direct (via SSH tunnels)
- Simplify deployment and maintenance
- Leverage Apple Vision Pro's native capabilities

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. **Native Swift/visionOS Development**
- **Rationale**: Optimal performance, seamless AR integration, and access to platform-specific features
- **Technology**: SwiftUI + RealityKit for UI and AR rendering

### 2. **SSH Tunneling Approach**
- **Rationale**: Security requirement from the lab environment
- **Implementation**: SwiftNIO SSH for native Swift SSH client
- **Pattern**: Each VNC connection gets its own SSH tunnel with dynamically allocated local ports

### 3. **Local Data Persistence**
- **Core Data**: For complex relational data (connection profiles, layouts)
- **Keychain**: For secure credential storage
- **UserDefaults**: For simple preferences

### 4. **Modular Service Architecture**
- **Rationale**: Separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability
- **Key Services**:
  - Connection Manager (orchestration)
  - SSH Tunnel Service
  - VNC Client Service
  - Authentication Manager
  - Layout Manager
  - Port Manager

### 5. **AR Window Rendering Strategy**
- **RealityKit Entities**: Each remote desktop as a plane entity
- **Metal Textures**: Direct VNC framebuffer to Metal texture conversion
- **Gesture Recognition**: Native visionOS input handling

## Security Architecture

1. **Credential Storage**: iOS Keychain with biometric protection
2. **Network Security**: All traffic through SSH tunnels
3. **Session Management**: Time-based credential caching with automatic cleanup
4. **Error Handling**: No credential leakage in logs or error messages

## Performance Considerations

1. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse SSH connections when possible
2. **Lazy Loading**: VNC streams only active when windows are visible
3. **Frame Rate Limiting**: Adaptive quality based on network conditions
4. **Memory Management**: Stream-based processing, aggressive cleanup

## Scalability Approach

1. **Concurrent Connections**: Limited by device resources (suggested max: 6-8)
2. **Port Management**: Dynamic allocation from pool (10000-20000)
3. **Resource Monitoring**: Built-in performance tracking

## Development Roadmap

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - 6 weeks
- Single connection support
- Basic authentication
- Simple AR window display
- Manual connection management

### Version 1.0 - 12 weeks
- Multiple concurrent connections
- Layout saving/loading
- Full keyboard/mouse support
- Error recovery
- Polish and optimization

### Future Enhancements
- SSH key authentication
- Connection sharing/collaboration
- Advanced window layouts (curved displays)
- Performance recording/playback

## Risk Mitigation

1. **VNC Library Compatibility**: Two implementation options (LibVNCClient wrapper or pure Swift)
2. **SSH Library Fallback**: Alternative to SwiftNIO SSH if needed
3. **Performance Issues**: Metal-based rendering with fallback to lower quality
4. **Authentication Complexity**: Progressive disclosure with sensible defaults

## Success Metrics

1. **Connection Time**: < 5 seconds from initiation to display
2. **Frame Rate**: Minimum 30 FPS for active windows
3. **Latency**: < 100ms input to display update
4. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for established connections
5. **User Satisfaction**: Intuitive setup, minimal configuration required

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the Virtual Control Room application while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and optimizations.
