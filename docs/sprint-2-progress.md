# Sprint 2 Progress: SSH Tunnel Integration

## Overview
Sprint 2 focuses on implementing secure SSH tunneling for VNC connections. This document tracks progress and provides testing guidance.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **SSH Testing Framework**
   - Created `SSHConnectionService.swift` with independent testing capabilities
   - Built `SSHTestView.swift` for manual validation of SSH components
   - Added SSH test to Settings ‚Üí Developer section

2. **SSH Architecture Setup**
   - Created `SSHTunnelManager.swift` for VNC integration
   - Defined SSH configuration structures and error handling
   - Set up testing framework that validates each component separately

3. **UI Infrastructure**
   - SSH settings already exist in ConnectionEditView
   - SSH test view provides comprehensive testing interface
   - Connection profiles already support SSH fields in Core Data

### üîÑ In Progress
4. **SwiftNIO SSH Integration**
   - Package dependency needs to be added through Xcode
   - See `docs/ssh-setup-instructions.md` for detailed steps

### ‚è≥ Pending
5. **Real SSH Implementation**
   - Replace simulation methods with actual SwiftNIO SSH calls
   - Implement password and key-based authentication
   - Create real SSH tunnels with port forwarding

6. **VNC Integration**
   - Update ConnectionManager to use SSH tunnels
   - Modify VNC connection flow to go through SSH
   - Test multi-connection scenarios with tunnels

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Independent SSH Testing ‚úÖ
Use the SSH Test View (`Settings ‚Üí Test SSH Connection`) to validate:

- **Connection Tests**: Basic SSH connectivity to servers
- **Authentication Tests**: Password and private key authentication
- **Tunnel Tests**: SSH tunnel creation and port allocation
- **Error Handling**: Timeout and failure scenarios

### Phase 2: SSH Integration (Next)
- Integrate SSH tunneling with VNC connections
- Test VNC through SSH tunnels
- Validate multi-connection tunnel scenarios

### Phase 3: Production Testing (Future)
- Performance testing with real servers
- Security validation
- Stability and cleanup testing

## Connection Flow Design

### Current (Sprint 1.5)
```
User ‚Üí VNC Connection ‚Üí Remote Desktop
```

### Target (Sprint 2)
```
User ‚Üí SSH Authentication ‚Üí SSH Tunnel ‚Üí VNC Connection ‚Üí Remote Desktop
```

### Implementation Plan
1. SSH connection established first
2. SSH tunnel created for VNC port forwarding
3. VNC connects to localhost:tunnel_port instead of remote host
4. All VNC traffic flows through encrypted SSH tunnel

## Testing Instructions

### 1. SSH Test View
1. Open app ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Test SSH Connection
2. Configure SSH settings:
   - Host: Your SSH server
   - Port: Usually 22
   - Username: SSH username
   - Authentication: Password or private key

3. Run tests in sequence:
   - Test Connection (validates SSH connectivity)
   - Test Auth (validates authentication method)
   - Test Tunnel (validates port forwarding setup)
   - Full Test (runs all tests in sequence)

### 2. Connection Profile SSH Settings
1. Create/edit connection profile
2. Toggle "Use SSH Tunnel"
3. Configure SSH settings
4. Save profile

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Need user action)
1. **Add SwiftNIO SSH Package**
   - Follow instructions in `docs/ssh-setup-instructions.md`
   - This requires opening Xcode and adding the package dependency

### After Package Addition
1. **Replace Simulation Code**
   - Update `SSHConnectionService.swift` to use real SwiftNIO SSH
   - Implement actual authentication and tunneling

2. **VNC Integration**
   - Update `ConnectionManager` to use `SSHTunnelManager`
   - Modify VNC connection flow to use tunnel ports

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test with real SSH servers
   - Validate tunnel security and performance
   - Test multi-connection scenarios

## Security Considerations

- SSH private keys stored securely (future: Keychain integration)
- Host key verification implementation planned
- Connection timeouts and retry logic included
- Tunnel port management prevents conflicts

## Architecture Benefits

- **Independent Testing**: Each SSH component can be validated separately
- **Modular Design**: SSH and VNC concerns are separated
- **Scalable**: Supports multiple simultaneous SSH tunnels
- **Secure**: All VNC traffic encrypted through SSH
- **Flexible**: Supports both password and key-based SSH authentication
