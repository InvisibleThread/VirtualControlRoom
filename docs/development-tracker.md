## Current Sprint: 1 - Connection Profile UI

**Goal**: Create UI for managing connection profiles without backend functionality
**Started**: Not started
**Target Completion**: 2-3 days

### Sprint Tasks
- [ ] Create ConnectionProfile data model
- [ ] Set up Core Data for persistence
- [ ] Build profile list view
- [ ] Add create/edit profile form
- [ ] Implement delete functionality
- [ ] Add basic form validation

### What You Can Test
- Launch app and navigate to Connections tab

## Sprint Testing Checkpoints

### Sprint 0.5 - VNC Proof of Concept ✅
**What to Test:**
- Set up local VNC server on your Mac:
  - System Settings → Sharing → Screen Sharing (enable)
  - Or use `brew install tigervnc` for test server
- Launch app and see if VNC connection works
- Verify remote desktop displays in AR window
- Check frame rate and image quality
- Test basic mouse movement (if implemented)

**Success Criteria:**
- VNC library compiles for visionOS
- Can connect to local VNC server
- Remote desktop visible in spatial window
- Frame updates work (even if slow)
- No crashes or memory leaks

**How to Test Locally:**
```bash
# Option 1: Enable Mac Screen Sharing
# System Settings → Sharing → Screen Sharing

# Option 2: Run test VNC server
brew install tigervnc
vncserver :1 -geometry 1024x768 -depth 24
# Password: testpass
# Connect to localhost:5901
```

## Development Approach

### Sprint Structure
- **Duration**: 2-3 days per sprint
- **Goal**: Deliver testable functionality each sprint
- **Testing**: User can test at end of each sprint
- **Feedback**: Incorporated into next sprint

### Testing Philosophy
- Every sprint produces something you can see/interact with
- Start with UI/UX, add backend functionality incrementally  
- Mock complex features first, then implement real versions
- Fail fast - identify issues early through frequent testing

## Current Week Notes

### Sprint 0 (Complete)
- ✅ Basic visionOS project setup
- ✅ Hello World with immersive space
- ✅ Git repository configured
- ✅ Development environment ready

### Sprint 0.5 (Complete) - VNC Proof of Concept ✅
- **Result**: Successfully created mock VNC implementation
- Implemented:
  1. Mock VNC client that simulates connection
  2. Frame buffer to RealityKit texture conversion
  3. AR window display of "remote desktop"
- **Next Steps**: Implement real VNC protocol (Sprint 4)
- **Key Learning**: RealityKit texture updates work smoothly

### Sprint 1 (After PoC)
- Focus: Connection profile CRUD UI
- No SSH/VNC functionality yet
- Pure SwiftUI/Core Data implementation
- Establishes app navigation structure

## Quick Start for Testing

1. **Open in Xcode**: Open `VirtualControlRoom.xcodeproj`
2. **Select Target**: Choose visionOS Simulator or device
3. **Run**: Press Cmd+R to build and run
4. **Test**: Follow the sprint-specific testing checklist above

## Communication

**After Each Sprint:**
- I'll notify you when a sprint is complete
- You test the specific features for that sprint
- Provide feedback on what works/doesn't work
- We adjust the next sprint based on feedback

**What to Look For:**
- Is the UI intuitive?
- Are there missing features you expected?
- Any confusing workflows?
- Performance issues?
- Visual/design feedback?
