# VNC Error Handling Implementation

## Critical LibVNC Crash Fix - December 13, 2024

### PROBLEM SOLVED: EXC_BAD_ACCESS crashes on invalid host connections

**Issue**: App was crashing with EXC_BAD_ACCESS when attempting to connect to invalid hosts (e.g., 999.999.999.999)

**Root Cause**: 
1. When `rfbInitClient()` fails, it internally calls `rfbClientCleanup()`
2. `rfbClientCleanup()` triggers VNC callbacks during cleanup process
3. These callbacks access `client->clientData` (pointing to wrapper object) AFTER the object may be deallocated
4. Result: Memory access violation crash

**Solution Implemented**:
- Set `client->clientData = NULL` initially to prevent callback crashes
- Only set callbacks and clientData AFTER `rfbInitClient()` succeeds
- Use captured delegate/timer references for safe error reporting
- Prevents double-cleanup and callback-during-cleanup scenarios

**Reference Issues**:
- LibVNC GitHub Issue #205: rfbClientCleanup() crashes at free(client->serverHost)
- LibVNC GitHub Issue #47: crash at function rfbClientCleanup

**Files Modified**: `LibVNCWrapper.m` lines 114-135, 175-178, 218-223

## Summary of Error Handling Features

I've implemented comprehensive error handling for VNC connection failures with the following features:

### 1. Connection Timeout (10 seconds)
- Added a timer-based timeout mechanism in `LibVNCWrapper.m`
- If connection doesn't complete within 10 seconds, shows error: "Connection timed out after 10 seconds. The server at [host]:[port] is not responding."
- Timer is cancelled if connection succeeds or fails before timeout

### 2. Error Propagation
- Added custom log handler to capture LibVNC error messages
- Added `hasReportedError` flag to prevent duplicate error reports
- Ensures errors from `rfbInitClient` are properly propagated to the UI

### 3. Enhanced Error Dialog
- Modified alert in `VNCTestView.swift` with two options:
  - "Back to Connections" - Disconnects and navigates back
  - "Try Again" - Allows retry from current view
- Added automatic error detection via `onChange` handlers

### 4. User-Friendly Error Messages
- Connection timeout: "Connection timed out after 10 seconds..."
- Connection refused: "Connection refused. VNC server may not be running..."
- Network unreachable: "Cannot reach server. Check network connection..."
- Generic failure: "Unable to connect to VNC server..."

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Non-Existent Server**:
   - Enter an IP address that doesn't exist (e.g., 192.168.1.999)
   - Should see timeout error after 10 seconds

2. **Test Connection Refused**:
   - Enter a valid IP but wrong port (e.g., your router IP with port 5900)
   - Should see connection refused error quickly

3. **Test Invalid Host**:
   - Enter invalid hostname (e.g., "notaserver")
   - Should see connection error

4. **Test Network Issues**:
   - Disconnect from network and try to connect
   - Should see network unreachable error

## Key Files Modified

1. **LibVNCClient.swift**:
   - Added 30-second timeout timer (as backup)
   - Enhanced error messages based on error type
   - Added timer cleanup on disconnect

2. **LibVNCWrapper.m**:
   - Added 10-second connection timeout timer
   - Added custom log handler for LibVNC messages
   - Added error reporting flag to prevent duplicates
   - Enhanced error detection based on errno

3. **VNCTestView.swift**:
   - Added navigation back to connection list on error
   - Added automatic error detection
   - Enhanced error dialog with multiple options

## Debug Output

When a connection fails, you should see console output like:
```
üöÄ VNC: Calling rfbInitClient...
üîµ LibVNC: ConnectToTcpAddr: connect
üîµ LibVNC: Unable to connect to VNC server
‚ùå VNC: rfbInitClient failed for 192.168.86.244:5900
‚è∞ VNC: Connection timeout fired (if timeout occurs)
```

And the UI should show an error dialog with the appropriate message.
