# VNC Error Handling Specification
*Virtual Control Room - Comprehensive Error Management for VNC Connections*

## Overview

This document defines all error scenarios that must be handled by a modern, robust VNC client and specifies the appropriate user experience for each. This serves as the specification for implementing comprehensive error handling in Virtual Control Room.

## Error Recovery Strategies

### Automatic Recovery
1. **Connection Retry**: 3 automatic attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 3s, 9s)
2. **Quality Reduction**: Automatic reduction in encoding quality on performance issues
3. **Heartbeat Recovery**: Automatic ping/pong to detect and recover from silent disconnects
4. **Background Reconnection**: Attempt reconnection when app returns from background

### User-Initiated Recovery
1. **Manual Retry**: User can retry any failed operation
2. **Connection Reset**: Full disconnection and reconnection
3. **Settings Adjustment**: Direct access to connection parameters
4. **Profile Recreation**: Option to recreate corrupted connection profiles

### Graceful Degradation
1. **Quality Scaling**: Reduce encoding quality before failure
2. **Feature Disable**: Disable non-essential features (audio, clipboard) to maintain connection
3. **Frame Skipping**: Skip frames rather than disconnect on performance issues
4. **Input Buffering**: Queue input events during temporary disconnections

## User Experience Guidelines

### Error Message Design
- **Clear & Actionable**: Every error explains what happened and what the user can do
- **Context-Aware**: Include specific details (hostname, port, error codes)
- **Consistent Tone**: Professional but friendly, avoid technical jargon
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Critical errors are alerts, warnings are toasts, info is inline

### Recovery Action Priorities
1. **Auto-fix** (if safe and likely to succeed)
2. **Retry** (most common user action)
3. **Adjust Settings** (when user can fix the issue)
4. **Get Help** (when user needs external assistance)
5. **Cancel/Exit** (always available as last resort)

### Notification Timing
- **Immediate**: Critical errors that block operation
- **Deferred**: Performance warnings that don't require immediate action
- **Batched**: Multiple similar errors grouped together
- **Persistent**: Connection status always visible in UI

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Stability (Immediate)
- All hard crash scenarios eliminated
- Basic connection establishment errors
- Authentication failure handling
- Connection timeout management

### Phase 2: User Experience (Next Sprint)

- Graceful disconnection handling
- Performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
- Automatic quality adjustment
- Background reconnection
- Advanced recovery strategies
- Detailed diagnostics and logging

## Testing Requirements

### Error Simulation
