IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE

This project includes GPL-licensed components that affect the overall license:

- LibVNC (GNU GPL v2): Located in VirtualControlRoom/build-libs/libvncserver/
  
Due to the inclusion of GPL v2 licensed LibVNC library, the complete application
must be distributed under GPL v2 terms. The GPL is a "copyleft" license that
requires any software using GPL components to also be licensed under GPL.

While the original Virtual Control Room source code (excluding LibVNC) is
offered under the BSD 3-Clause License above, the combined work including
LibVNC must comply with GPL v2 terms.

For GPL compliance requirements, see THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md

For a truly BSD-licensed version, LibVNC would need to be replaced with a
BSD/MIT/Apache 2.0 compatible VNC implementation.
