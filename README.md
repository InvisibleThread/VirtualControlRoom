## Requirements

- **Device**: Apple Vision Pro
- **OS**: visionOS 2.0 or later
- **Network**: WiFi or Ethernet connection
- **Server Requirements**:
  - SSH server with port forwarding enabled
  - VNC server (TightVNC, RealVNC, TigerVNC, etc.)
  - Valid SSH credentials (password or key-based)

## Quick Start

1. **Install the app** from TestFlight
2. **Create a connection profile**:
   - Tap "Add Connection"
   - Enter your SSH server details
   - Configure VNC settings (typically localhost:5900 when tunneled)
   - Save the profile
3. **Connect**:
   - Select your profile from the list
   - Enter SSH password/OTP if prompted
   - Your remote desktop appears in a spatial window
4. **Interact**:
   - Look at the window and tap to focus
   - Use keyboard for text input
   - Tap for mouse clicks, long press for right-click
   - Pinch and drag to move windows in space

## Security Best Practices

1. **Always use SSH tunneling** - Never expose VNC directly to the internet
2. **Use strong passwords** or SSH key authentication
3. **Enable two-factor authentication** where possible
4. **Keep your SSH and VNC servers updated**
5. **Use encrypted VNC sessions** when available
