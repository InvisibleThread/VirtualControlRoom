# Current Work Status - Virtual Control Room

## Date: January 11, 2025

### Last Completed Task
✅ Implemented VNC password prompt functionality
- Users are now prompted for password when connecting to password-protected VNC servers
- Added retry mechanism with password
- Committed to branch: `feature/libvnc-client`

### Current Sprint Status
**Sprint 0.5**: ✅ COMPLETE (with password prompt enhancement)

### Architecture Issues to Address

1. **Library Architecture Mismatch**
   - libvnc libraries compiled for arm64
   - Simulator requires x86_64
   - Need to rebuild libvnc with correct architecture or use universal binary
   - Location: `/VirtualControlRoom/ThirdParty/libvnc/lib/`

2. **Build Configuration**
   - May need separate build configs for device vs simulator
   - Consider using XCFramework for multi-architecture support

### Next Development Tasks

1. **Fix Architecture Issues**
   - Rebuild libvnc for x86_64 (simulator)
   - Or create universal binary (arm64 + x86_64)
   - Update build settings accordingly

2. **Sprint 1 - Connection Profile UI** (Ready to start)
   - Core Data models for connection profiles
   - CRUD operations for managing connections
   - Profile selection UI
   - Integration with existing VNC connection code

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Keychain integration for password storage
   - Remember password option in connection profiles
   - Support for SSH tunnel connections
   - Multiple simultaneous connections

### Important Files/Locations

- Main VNC Client: `/VirtualControlRoom/Services/VNC/LibVNCClient.swift`
- VNC Wrapper: `/VirtualControlRoom/Services/VNC/LibVNCWrapper.m`
- Test UI: `/VirtualControlRoom/VNCTestView.swift`
- Project file: `/VirtualControlRoom/VirtualControlRoom.xcodeproj`

### Git Status
- Branch: `feature/libvnc-client`
- Latest commit: `04e5659 Implement VNC password prompt functionality`
- All changes committed

### Notes for Next Session
1. First priority: Fix the architecture mismatch to get builds working
2. Test password prompt with actual password-protected VNC server
3. Consider moving to Sprint 1 (Connection Profile UI) once builds are working
4. The password prompt implementation is complete but untested due to build issues
