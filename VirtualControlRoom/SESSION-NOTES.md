# VNC Implementation Session Notes

## Session Date: Current - LibVNCClient Implementation
## Status: Migrating from RoyalVNCKit to LibVNCClient

### ✅ Completed in This Session

#### Mouse and Keyboard Input Implementation
1. **Mouse Input**: ✅ WORKING
   - Added tap and drag gesture handlers to VNCSimpleWindowView
   - Implemented coordinate transformation from SwiftUI to VNC coordinates
   - Proper handling of aspect ratio and display area calculation
   - Mouse events correctly forwarded to VNC server via `sendPointerEvent`

2. **Keyboard Input**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Added keyboard focus management with `@FocusState`
   - Implemented key press handling with character-to-keysym conversion
   - Key events forwarded via `sendKeyEvent` method

3. **Window Aspect Ratio**: ✅ FIXED
   - Added `.windowResizability(.contentSize)` to WindowGroup for visionOS
   - Window maintains proper VNC display aspect ratio (8:2 for 8000x2000)
   - Prevents non-uniform scaling

4. **Performance Optimization**: ✅ FIXED
   - Fixed CGBitmap context errors for 8000px wide displays
   - Implemented intelligent image scaling (max 3840x2160)
   - Clean bitmap context creation with proper color space
   - Eliminated console spam from CGBitmap errors

#### Current Implementation Status
- **VNCSimpleWindowView.swift**: 
  - Mouse input: tap gestures + drag gestures with coordinate transformation
  - Keyboard input: focus management + keysym conversion  
  - Clean UI with proper aspect ratio constraints
  
- **RoyalVNCClient.swift**:
  - `sendPointerEvent(x, y, buttonMask)` - working but with placeholder print statements
  - `sendKeyEvent(keysym, down)` - working but with placeholder print statements
  - Image scaling optimized for large displays
  
- **VirtualControlRoomApp.swift**:
  - WindowGroup configured with `.windowResizability(.contentSize)`

### ✅ COMPLETED: Final RoyalVNCKit Integration

#### Successfully Implemented Real Input Forwarding
1. **Found and Implemented Correct RoyalVNCKit Methods**:
   - Mouse input: `mouseMove()`, `mouseButtonDown()`, `mouseButtonUp()`
   - Keyboard input: `keyDown()`, `keyUp()` with `VNCKeyCode`
   - Replaced all placeholder `print()` statements with actual API calls

2. **Working Implementation**:
   - Mouse coordinates correctly converted and forwarded via `mouseMove(x:y:)`
   - Mouse button states handled via `mouseButtonDown/Up(.left/.middle/.right)`
   - Keyboard events converted from keysym to `VNCKeyCode` and sent via `keyDown/Up()`
   - Build succeeds with no compilation errors

#### Current Test Results
- ✅ Mouse coordinates correctly calculated (console shows proper VNC coords)
- ✅ Keyboard events captured (console shows keysym conversion)
- ✅ Window aspect ratio locked to VNC display ratio
- ✅ No more CGBitmap errors in console
- ✅ Performance optimized for 8000x2000 displays

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Mouse Coordinate Conversion
```swift
// Handles 8000x2000 -> UI coordinates -> VNC coordinates
// Accounts for aspect ratio and letterboxing
// Working correctly based on console output
```

#### Keyboard Keysym Mapping
```swift
// Basic ASCII to VNC keysym conversion
// Return: 0xFF0D, Tab: 0xFF09, Backspace: 0xFF08
// ASCII chars: direct mapping for 32-126
```

#### Image Scaling
```swift
// 8000x2000 -> 3840x1536 (maintains 4:1 aspect ratio)
// Fixes CGBitmap context errors
// Improves UI performance
```

### Git Status
- All changes implemented and building successfully
- Ready for final RoyalVNCKit method integration
- Next commit should be: "Complete Sprint 0.5: Working mouse and keyboard input"

### LibVNCClient Migration (New Development)

#### Background
RoyalVNCKit's `cgImage` property consistently returns `nil` with certain VNC servers (particularly TightVNC on Windows). This is a fundamental limitation that blocks proper VNC display functionality.

#### Solution: LibVNCClient Implementation
Created a complete LibVNCClient wrapper to replace RoyalVNCKit:

1. **Branch**: `feature/libvnc-client`

2. **Architecture**:
   - `LibVNCWrapper.h/m` - Objective-C wrapper around LibVNCClient C library
   - `LibVNCClient.swift` - Swift implementation conforming to VNCClient protocol
   - Bridging header for Swift/ObjC interop

3. **Key Features**:
   - Direct access to framebuffer pixel data
   - Proper CGImage conversion from raw pixels
   - Support for all VNC server types (macOS Screen Sharing, TightVNC, etc.)
   - Same API surface as RoyalVNCClient for drop-in replacement

4. **Implementation Status**:
   - ✅ Complete wrapper implementation
   - ✅ Framebuffer to CGImage conversion
   - ✅ Mouse/keyboard input forwarding
   - ✅ Authentication handling
   - ✅ Error handling and connection states
   - ⏳ Pending: Add libvncclient to Xcode project

### Next Steps for Xcode Integration

1. **Install LibVNCClient**:
   ```bash
   brew install libvnc
   ```

2. **Configure Xcode Project**:
   - Set bridging header: `VirtualControlRoom-Bridging-Header.h`
   - Add library search paths: `/opt/homebrew/lib` (Apple Silicon) or `/usr/local/lib` (Intel)
   - Add header search paths: `/opt/homebrew/include` (Apple Silicon) or `/usr/local/include` (Intel)
   - Link libraries: `-lvncclient`

3. **Build Settings**:
   - OTHER_LDFLAGS: `-lvncclient`
   - HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS: `$(inherited) /opt/homebrew/include`
   - LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS: `$(inherited) /opt/homebrew/lib`

### Sprint 0.5 Status: ✅ COMPLETE (with RoyalVNCKit)
*Note: Functionality complete but cgImage issue led to LibVNCClient migration*

### LibVNCClient Migration: ✅ COMPLETE

#### Successfully Migrated to LibVNCClient
1. **Migration Completed**:
   - ✅ Removed RoyalVNCKit dependency
   - ✅ Implemented complete LibVNCClient wrapper (Objective-C + Swift)
   - ✅ Updated all UI components to use LibVNCClient
   - ✅ Project builds successfully for visionOS simulator
   - ✅ Pre-built libvnc libraries included in ThirdParty directory

2. **Key Implementation Files**:
   - `LibVNCWrapper.h/m` - Objective-C wrapper around libvncclient C library
   - `LibVNCClient.swift` - Swift wrapper conforming to VNCClient protocol
   - `VirtualControlRoom-Bridging-Header.h` - Configured for Swift/ObjC interop
   - All VNC UI views updated to use LibVNCClient

3. **Technical Benefits**:
   - Direct framebuffer access (no more nil cgImage issues)
   - Better compatibility with all VNC server types
   - Improved performance with large displays
   - Same API surface as RoyalVNCClient for easy migration

4. **Build Configuration**:
   - Using pre-built libraries in `ThirdParty/libvnc/`
   - Header search paths: `$(SRCROOT)/ThirdParty/libvnc/include`
   - Library search paths: `$(SRCROOT)/ThirdParty/libvnc/lib`
   - Linker flags: `-lvncclient -lvncserver`

*Ready to proceed with Sprint 1: Connection Profile UI*

## Sprint 1 Planning: Connection Profile UI

### Objective
Create a complete UI for managing VNC connection profiles with Core Data persistence. This sprint focuses on the user interface and data model without implementing actual connection functionality.

### Key Deliverables
1. **Core Data Model**:
   - ConnectionProfile entity with fields: name, host, port, username, sshHost, sshPort, sshUsername
   - Persistence across app launches

2. **UI Components**:
   - Connection list view with SwiftUI List
   - Add/Edit profile form with validation
   - Delete functionality with swipe-to-delete
   - Empty state when no connections exist

3. **Navigation Structure**:
   - Tab-based navigation (Connections, Settings)
   - Sheet presentation for add/edit forms
   - Proper navigation titles and buttons

### Technical Approach
- Use Core Data with CloudKit for potential sync (later)
- SwiftUI forms with proper validation
- @FetchRequest for reactive list updates
- Proper error handling for data operations

### User Testing Points
- Can create profiles with all required fields
- Validation prevents invalid data entry
- Profiles persist between app launches
- Edit and delete operations work smoothly
- UI is intuitive for non-technical users
