# VNC Password Prompt Implementation

## Status: COMPLETED (January 11, 2025)

### Overview
Implemented password prompt functionality for VNC connections to handle password-protected servers. Previously, the system was sending an empty string when no password was provided, causing connections to fail silently.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. LibVNCClient.swift Changes
- Added `@Published var passwordRequired: Bool = false` to track when password is needed
- Added `pendingConnection` to store connection details for retry attempts
- Added `retryWithPassword(_ password: String)` method to retry connection with user-provided password
- Modified `vncRequiresPassword()` to set appropriate state and error message

#### 2. LibVNCWrapper Changes
- Added `vncRequiresPassword` to the `LibVNCWrapperDelegate` protocol
- Modified `passwordCallback` to:
  - First check for saved password
  - Ask delegate for password if none saved
  - Notify delegate when no password is available
  - Return empty string to fail authentication gracefully

#### 3. VNCTestView.swift Changes
- Added `@State private var showPasswordPrompt = false`
- Added `@State private var promptedPassword = ""`
- Implemented password prompt alert with:
  - SecureField for password entry
  - Connect button that calls `retryWithPassword()`
  - Cancel button that disconnects the session
- Added `onChange` observer for `vncClient.passwordRequired`

### How It Works

1. User attempts to connect to a password-protected VNC server
2. LibVNC's password callback is triggered
3. If no password is saved, the callback returns empty string
4. Connection fails with authentication error
5. `vncRequiresPassword()` is called, setting `passwordRequired = true`
6. UI detects change and shows password prompt alert
7. User enters password and clicks Connect
8. `retryWithPassword()` is called with the entered password
9. Connection is retried with the provided password

### Technical Considerations

- LibVNC uses synchronous callbacks, so we can't show UI prompts during the callback
- Solution: Fail the initial connection and retry with password
- Password is temporarily stored during connection attempt
- Clear password after use for security

### Testing Notes

- Test with password-protected VNC servers
- Verify prompt appears when no password provided
- Verify cancel properly disconnects
- Verify retry works with correct password
- Test with incorrect password (should re-prompt)

### Next Steps

- Consider implementing password storage in Keychain for remembered connections
- Add option to save password with connection profile
- Implement timeout for password prompt
- Add support for username/password authentication (if needed)

### Build Issues Note

Current build fails due to architecture mismatch with libvnc libraries (arm64 vs x86_64 for simulator). This is a separate issue from the password prompt implementation and needs to be addressed by rebuilding libvnc for the correct architecture.
